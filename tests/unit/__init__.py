"""
:mod:`tests.unit` package.

Unit tests for the :mod:`etlplus` package.

Notes
-----
- What they test: A single function/class/method in isolation.
- Dependencies: Replaced with fakes/mocks/stubs (no real network, DB,
    filesystem unless you’re explicitly doing “unit-ish with temp dirs”).
- Goal: Fast, precise feedback; pin down behavior and edge cases.
